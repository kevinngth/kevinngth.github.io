# Portfolio Version 3

Built after I graduated from GA. Neomorphism seems to be the new thing in town.
<!-- The previous 2 versions are archived [here]() & [here](). -->

### Credits

I used [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) for my images and would like to thank the following artist, in no order of merit, for their works: Clem Onojeghuo, Wes Hicks

Do look at [this tutorial](https://dev.to/javascripterika/deploy-a-react-app-as-a-github-user-page-with-yarn-3fka) if you'd like to know how to create-(a)-react-app as a GitHub user page.

### Technologies used

[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

[Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)

[React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.com/)

[React Icons](https://react-icons.netlify.com/#/)

### Approach

Took this on with the intention to practise using React Hooks, CSS animations and Sass. Used state instead of React Router to render the components in the main area. I had fun breaking up all my code into small components that didn't exceed a hundred lines each, made editing and bug fixing such a breeze. Most of the styling is done by .scss stylesheets and housed in the same folder as the components. Wanted to do most of the CSS from scratch but in the end, I found that I still relied a lot on Bootstrap for their preset layout tools.

### Installation Instructions

My first time writing installation instructions

To run development mode, clone repo from source branch.
> Note that in order to publish your production build on user pages, the compiled code has to the master branch.

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

That's it.

There are guides depending if you want to publish as a [project page](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages) or as a [user page](https://dev.to/javascripterika/deploy-a-react-app-as-a-github-user-page-with-yarn-3fka)
